                I am Shamanth, a recent computer science graduate from the{" "}

                . My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning,
                causal modeling, medical analyses, and software development. In
                January 2025, I will continue my education as a Master's student
                in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

                I am currently an ML research intern at{" "}
                <a href="https://iomics.ai/">IOMICS Corporation</a>, where I
                focus on building automated casual estimation pipelines for
                multi-omics data. In addition, I recently completed an
                independent study under the supervision of{" "}
                <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/">Cameron Musco</a>{" "}
                where I applied spectral analysis on structural brain
                connectomic networks to classify brain regions.
